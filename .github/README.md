# Get-ExtendedAttributes

Get-ExtendedAttributes (**gea**) is a Powershell module for accessing the extended attributes of files.

(ðŸ‘·This documentation is an active work in progressðŸ‘·)

## Description

The Get-ExtendedAttributes module provides functionality similar to the *Get-ChildItem* cmdlet. Instead of basic file attributes, however, **gea** enumerates and returns attributes not easily exposed to Powershell.

**These attributes include:**

* **Video** (image/sound/combined bitrates, length, resolution, encoding, etc)
* **Music** (bitrate, length, artist, album, title, track, etc)
* **Image/EXIF** (resolution, camera information, focal length, ISO, orientation, etc)
* **Contacts** (Name, address, street, phone number, email address, etc)
* **Email** (To, From, Attachments, CC, BCC, send/received dates, subject, etc)
* **Documents** (Due date, word count, last-printed, last-saved, classification, pages, etc)

* [And many more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22382010/what-options-are-available-for-shell32-folder-getdetailsof/62279888#62279888)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

**Get-ExtendedAttributes** has the following dependencies:
* Microsoft Windows OS (Windows 7 or greater, Windows Server 2008 or greater)
* Windows Powershell (5.1+ recommended)


### Installing
Save the *Get-ExtendedAttributes* folder to any one of these three folders:

```
C:\Users\<username>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules        
C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules
```


### Importing the Module

Import the module using the following command:

```
Import-Module Get-ExtendedAttributes
```

* **Note:** The module exports the path of a "Helper File" as variable $HelperFile. This is used to *greatly* improve the speed and efficiency of **gea**. Details on how to use the helper file are explained below.


### Using Get-ExtendedAttributes

* Running the function is simple:

```
Get-ExtendedAttributes
```

Alternatively, you can use the alias **gea**

```
gea
```


## The Helper File

**gea** is very quick when run without additional parameters for one or a small number of files.

In cases where there are a *large* number of files, the time it takes to query 500 attributes can cause **gea** to take a *very* long time to complete.

Thankfully, there's a clever solution to this problem.


### Understanding the Helper File

The Helper File is simply a JSON file called *exthelper.json*. It contains Keys (file extensions) and Values (applicable attributes for each file extension).

**gea** uses this file to limit the attribute retrievals to *only* attributes that are used by specific file types.

Instead of querying 500 attributes, when using the Helper File it will only query 30-40 (depending on the file type). This improves **gea**'s performance substantially.


### Where to get the Helper File

I have included a Helper File with the module that contains 315 extensions. This was generated from files on my systems and storage, and works perfectly (for me).


### How to use the Helper File

* If present when importing the module, the path to the Helper File is automatically assigned to the variable *$HelperFile*:

![Import-Module](/.github/images/import-module.png)

* When running **gea**, use the following parameters to use the Helper File:

```
Get-ExtendedAttributes -UseHelperFile -HelperFileName $HelperFile
```

**Note:** ðŸ‘· I realize how redundant it is to have a switch and an input variable for a single purpose. I will simplify this in the future ðŸ‘·


### How much *does* the Helper File actually improve performance?

That's a fair question. Here's a test against 410 files:

![HelperFile Speed](/.github/images/helperspeed.png)


| Without Helper| With Helper   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 83 seconds    | 10 seconds    |
| 4.94 files/sec| 41 files/sec  |

That's a difference of **8 times** faster when using the Helper File!


### How to make your own Helper File

If you have a unique or specific set of file types that aren't included in the provided set, I have included a function to create your own Helper File.

The function **New-AttrsHelperFile** is a tool to create your own Helper File. There is more on how to use this tool below.

## Parameters

**gea** contains many parameters to enhance its functionality and applicability.


* **Path**
The path of the directory or file you wish to retrieve extended attributes from.

This parameter is positional (*position 0*), and can be used without being named.


* **Recurse**
In cases where *-Path* is a directory, *-Recurse* will enumerate all subfolders and files within the provided path.

If *-Path* specifies a filename, *-Recurse* is ignored.


* **WriteProgress**
Displays a progress bar to support your mental health and welfare.

The progress bar reports which file it's enumerating attributes for, and displays the overall file progress.


* **UseHelperFile**
Instructs the function to use a helper file.

* **HelperFileName**
Provides the function with the path of the helper file to use.

**Note:** *-UserHelperFile* and *-HelperFileName* will be consolidated into a single parameter in the future (*soon!*).


* **Exclude**
Applies an exclusionary ("*where not match*") filter on subfolders and files. If *-Path* is a file, *-Exclude* is ignored.

To specify more than one filter, comma-separate the strings you'd like to exclude.

This example excludes all files and folders containing ".png" or ".ps1" anywhere in the filename:

```
$N = Get-ExtendedAttributes -Exclude .png,.ps1
```
**Note:** *-Exclude* does not respect asterisks. If there's a desire to use asterisks for filtering, ask and I'll write the feature in. (*Or do it yourself, it's open source!*)


* **Include**
Applies an inclusionary ("*where match*") filter **for files only**. If *-Path* is a file, *-Include* is ignored.

As with *-Exclude*, you can comma-separate multiple strings you'd like to include. 

Also as with *-Exclude*, *-Include* does not respect asterisks.


* **OmitEmptyFields**
Instructs the function to remove all columns in the resultant data which do not contain any values. *-Clean* is an alias of *-OmitEmptyFields*.

For example, a set of values that looks like this:

| Name  | address | Street | Phone Number   | Email Address | 
| ----- |-------- | ------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| John  | 123 st  |        |                |               |
| Jake  |         |        |                | no@ip.org     |
|       | 3rd ave.|        |                | yep@nope.com  |

Would be reduced to these fields:

| Name  | address | Email Address | 
| ----- |-------- | ------------- |
| John  | 123 st  |               |
| Jake  |         | no@ip.org     |
|       | 3rd ave.| yep@nope.com  |

This operation can take a lot of time, depending on how many files reside in the dataset.

As with the attribute lookups, the Helper File also reduces the number of possible empty fields. For this reason, it is *strongly* recommended that a Helper File be used when using *-OmitEmptyFields*.


* **ReportAccessErrors**


### ðŸ‘· Work In Progress!
Everything below this point is in the process of being written. Please check in periodically for updates as this documentation is created and completed. (*Last Update: 05/31/2022*)

## Help

I haven't encountered any problems with this function, more than likely due to its simplicity.

Because tracert.exe uses the standard Windows command line error handler, the cleanest and simplest way to check the success/fail status of tracert.exe is by looking at the $LASTEXITCODE variable.

The function contains an If statement to do exactly this:
```
If ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0 -and $LASTEXITCODE -ne $null){throw "traceroute returned LastExitCode $LASTEXITCODE"}
```

## Authors

I am the author.

## Version History

* 1.0 - Initial version.
    * It just works.

## Known Issues
* Strange/faulty behavior when working with files in UserProfile diectories (caused by NTUSER.DAT)
* Some file attribute values obtained from internet or non-Windows sources contain odd/wrong characters
    * I'm not convinced this is a problem with the module, but a future "helper" function may help fix these instances.
